Terms of use


In fact there is just one rule! 
If you use this framework, you need to add a link to this project-page or add the name "CMCrashReporter" in the about window.. 

The next thing isn't a rule but a request, add your application to the list with applications that uses the framework. 

You may edit the code and use it for a project (freeware - opensource - shareware ...) but it isn't permitted to sell the framework! 
The framework is opensource and not commercial! 
If you edit the framework, you still need to create a redict to the original framework!
