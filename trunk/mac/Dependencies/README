BUILDING DEPENDENCIES
To build for Windows, simply run "RUN_MAKE_FOR_WINDOWS.bat".
To build for Mac, simply type "Make"

Hopefully it's as simple as that! :P


HOW TO CREATE A PATCH

To create a patch for a folder "source":
1. Copy the original to a folder called "source-original"
2. Modify "source" as desired.
3. Execute the following command in "source"'s parent directory:
diff -rup source-original/ source/ > source_patch.patch
(if you want created/deleted files to be included, the options should be "-rupN")

To patch, execute the following command in "source"'s parent directory:
1. patch -p0 < source_patch.patch

HOW TO PREPARE A QT BUILD

1. Download and install the QT open source SDK.
(On Mac:
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/mac-os-cpp
http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.6.0.tar.gz
http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-mac-opensource-src-4.5.3.tar.gz)

2. Build it
ON WIN:

2. Go into C:\Qt\2009.03\qt
3. Execute the following commands:
> configure -no-qt3support -debug-and-release -no-webkit -no-scripttools -no-phonon -no-dbus -no-phonon-backend
> nmake sub-core
> nmake sub-gui
4. Copy the include, lib, and src directories into a new directory
5. Run the script clean_qt_dir.py to clean out unnecessary files (you will probably have to modify the hard-coded path inside it)


ON MAC:
2. on snow leopard, modify mkspecs/macx-g++/qmake.conf to say gcc-4.0 and g++-4.0

3. ./configure -cocoa -no-qt3support -no-scripttools -no-phonon -no-dbus -no-phonon-backend -platform macx-g++ -arch ppc -arch x86 -sdk /Developer/SDKS/MacOSX10.5.sdk -qt-libtiff -qt-libpng -qt-libmng -qt-libjpeg -fast -release  -opensource; gmake sub-tools-bootstrap sub-moc sub-corelib sub-uic sub-rcc sub-gui sub-network sub-xmlpatterns sub-webkit ; gmake --directory=src/plugins sub-imageformats

TO BUILD STATICALLY:

need to pass -static to configure.
you'll probably need to link to zlib and SystemConfiguration.framework
4. (ignore this) extra parameter to print out linker symbol map -Wl,-map,load.map
