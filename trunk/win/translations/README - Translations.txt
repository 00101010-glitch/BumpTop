A. Sending out strings to translators
-------------------------------------

1. Run generateTSfiles.bat to update the TS files from the source code.

2. For each language, run tsToTxt.py once for each of the various .ts files:

    python tsToTxt.py "..\Source\Languages\BumpTop_es.ts" .\BumpTop_es.txt
	python tsToTxt.py "..\Source\Languages\BumpTop_Multitouch_es.ts" .\Bumptop_Multitouch_ts.txt
	python tsToTxt.py "..\Source\Languages\BumpTop_Web_es.ts" .\BumpTop_Web_es.txt
    python tsToTxt.py "..\BumpTop Settings\project\Settings_es.ts" .\Settings_es.txt

3. Make a copy of Instructions.doc. It's a good idea to include the revision number that the strings were extracted from -- e.g. BumpTop_es_r5163.doc.

3. Copy and paste all the text files generated in step 2 into the .doc file.

4. SHIP!

B. Integrating translations
---------------------------

The process of merging translations is different for each one of the .ts files. Here are the instructions for the main translation file, in ..\Source\Languages\BumpTop_en.ts:

For BumpTop_<lang>.ts:
----------------------

1. Open the .doc file from the translator. Cut out the initial instruction pages, and save as a text file in Unicode format in this directory (e.g. BumpTop_es.txt).

2. Run mergeTxtAndTs.py, passing as args the text file from step 1, and the .ts file that you want to merge into. e.g.:

    python mergeTxtAndTs.py BumpTop_es.txt "..\Source\Languages\BumpTop_es.ts"
	
Watch for any warnings or error messages!

At the end, the script will ask if it should replace the original .ts with the merged version. If you had no errors or warnings (or if the warnings check out), say "Y" here. After replacing the original .ts file, lupdate and lrelease are run automatically.

3. All the .qm files generated by lrelease are named BumpTop_<lang>.qm -- rename them to BumpTop.<lang>.qm (just replace the "_" with a ".").
	
5. Check in your changes to the .ts files and the .qm files.
