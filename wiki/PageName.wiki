Todo: explain history of windows, mac codebases.  Windows was built of Anand's masters thesis research code, NOT following proper coding practices, rushing to deadline.  ie, project is stil named "SampleBoxes".  Mac is more modern, cleaner codebase but with reduced, simplified, focused features.  2 diff windows versions (more features, less blah).
